# Customer-Churn-Modelling-using-Multi-Layer-Perceptron

YouTube Lecture: https://youtu.be/lx2WKcE0ONc

In this tutorial, we will be discussing customer churn modeling using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. Churn modeling is a crucial aspect of businesses, as it helps in identifying customers who are likely to leave the company. MLP is a type of artificial neural network that can be used to predict customer churn. We will be covering the following topics in this tutorial:
- Introduction to customer churn modeling
- Understanding the MLP model
- Preparing the data for model training
- Training and evaluating the MLP model
- Interpreting the model's results

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement an MLP model for customer churn prediction. Please make sure you have the required libraries installed before starting the tutorial. This tutorial is geared towards intermediate to advanced data scientists and analysts who are familiar with machine learning concepts.
